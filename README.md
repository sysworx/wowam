# Wow Addon Manager
The WoW Addon Manager is a small help tool for the MMORPG World of Warcraft. The tool serves as an alternative for the Curse client, which is currently only available for Windows.

The World of Warcraft Addon Manager downloads the Curse.com addons, but the Curse Client's databases are not tapped here, as this is not legal. Our program collects the data directly from the website, it also collects Patreon links and offers you to support the developers and visit the homepage of the addons. With the support of Curse, we have clarified with Hellfir3 that this procedure is ok, as long as no viruses are spread or revenue generated.

Currently, the World of Warcraft Addon Manager is available for Windows and OSX (Mac). The program is not under developmentanymore.

WoW Addon Manager has its own update system to keep itself up-to-date, the tool also sends names of addons and their curse url to the "WoWam-Cloud". You can disable this option in the options menu. However, no other data is transferred, i do not want to attack your privacy and data.

WoW Addon Manager is a free project with which I as always no revenue, still wants to achieve. If you want to buy coffees, there is the donation button on my side.

# Wow Addon Manager
The WoW Addon Manager is a small help tool for the MMORPG World of Warcraft. The tool serves as an alternative for the Curse client, which is currently only available for Windows. Our WoW Addon Manager is initially only available for Windows during the initial development phase, but the tool is programmed in Xojo, so it is basically multi-platform capable.

The World of Warcraft Addon Manager downloads the Curse.com addons, but the Curse Client's databases are not tapped here, as this is not legal. Our program collects the data directly from the website, it also collects Patreon links and offers you to support the developers and visit the homepage of the addons. About the support of Curse, we have clarified with Hellfir3 that this procedure is in order, as long as no viruses are spread or revenue generated.

Currently, the World of Warcraft Addon Manager is only available for Windows, but a version for MacOS is already planned and will come soon. The program is under development, so there may be various bugs, I ask you to report them accordingly.

Maybe there will be a linux version too, but i dont know if this is worth. World of Warcraft is basically not available on linux. So i guess there are not many player out there.

WoW Addon Manager has its own update system to keep itself up-to-date, the tool also sends names of addons and their curse url to the "Wowam-Cloud". In the alpha version, this feature can be disabled, there is simply no options menu at the moment. However, no other data is transferred, I do not want to attack your privacy and data.

WoW Addon Manager is a free project with which I as always no revenue, still wants to achieve. If you want to buy coffees, there is the donation button on my side.
